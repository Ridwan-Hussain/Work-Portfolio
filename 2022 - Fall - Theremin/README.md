# Theremin
The theremin is a musical instrument that allows instrumentalist to play the instrument without touching it. There are two main antennas that help achieve this, a pitch antenna and a volume antenna. By bringing someone's hands close to the antenna, the pitch/volume can be increased.

The goal of this project was build the pitch antenna by utilizing that the capacitance of the antenna changes when someone's hand is close to it, which can change the frequency of an oscillator. 

Attached is the report that goes into detail about the project including the block diagram, how the circuit was built, and some images that display the final outputs of the theremin.
