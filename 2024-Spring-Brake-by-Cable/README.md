# Brake-by-Cable for Autonomy Lab
The purpose of the Brake-by-Cable (BBC) board was to support the new braking motor on the Polaris Gem e2 for the IGVC Competition. The PCB housed the motor controller to adjust the speed of the motor, as well as have a boost converter to power the brake pressure sensor, parking brake, and interfaced with the ESP32 base board to help control the braking power of the car. 

## LTSpice Simulations
- Files that include the simulations used to test the ADC range for the brake pressure line for better voltage range for the ESP32.

## PCB Files
- Files that include images of the PCB Schematic and Layout, as well as a zip of the final EasyEDA files for the PCB.
