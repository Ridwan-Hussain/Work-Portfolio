# Work-Portfolio
Hello, my name is Ridwan Hussain and I am an Electrical Engineer who will be graduating in 2025 from Cooper Union with my Bachelor's. The fields I'm most interested in are those related to Power Electronics, RF Engineering, DSP, and PCB design. Any job with one or multiple of these factors sounds interesting to me. If you'd like to contact me, my email is ridwanhussain115@gmail.com. 

This is a work portfolio displaying various projects worked on over the years. Below is a brief description for each of them.

# Project Descriptions
- <ins>Theremin</ins>: A project done in my sophomore lab fall semester that displays some basic RF building blocks (mixing, amplitude modulation, amplifier, and amplifier).
- <ins>Frequency Mixer</ins>: A project done in my junior lab fall semester year where the output of a Colpitts Oscillator and function generator were mixed using a different MOSFET tail current source on a bread board.
- <ins>Brake-by-Cable</ins>: A project done in my junior year spring semester where a new PCB was needed to actuate with a new DC motor for braking, measuring brake pressure levels, and activating the parking brake.
- <ins>ScopeTV</ins>: A project done in my junior year spring semester where the NTSC signal from a DVD player was taken so that an oscilloscope would display the video and a speaker would play the audio.
- <ins>16QAM</ins>: A project done in my senior year fall semester where an RF input signal (fc = 5.4GHz) would be modulated into 16QAM.
- <ins>SMPS</ins>: My senior project done with two other engineers (Azra Rangwala EE'25, Ilona Lameka EE'25), where we designed a switching power supply. The design include two independent channels, A & B, with 1V-20V & 0-3A output (supports series and parallel mode as well), along with a channel C which is a fixed 5V 3A USB-C port utilizing USB2.0.
