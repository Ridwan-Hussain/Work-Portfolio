# 16QAM
The final project for the Microwave Engineering class was to simulate a vector modulation that would take an RF input and output a 16QAM output in Keysight ADS.  The carrier frequency was 5.4GHz, with a 1.8GHz bandwidth, symbol rate of 900 MHz, 4 bits per symbol (2 bits for 0/180 phase modulations and 2 bits for attenuation), maximum 8.5dB insertion loss, 1.4 maximum VSWR, 3.5 phase accuracy, 0.7dB amplitude variation, and the design must be made using passive components. 

Attached on the project specifications, presentation, and report. The project specifications goes over the specifications (most of which are listed above). The presentation has an easier to follow slide deck that display an higher level overview of the project with a lot of images to help visualize the project and the simulation results. The report goes more in-depth on the different architecture chosen for the different blocks for the design and explain some of the design choices made during the development of the project. The final ADS files are also zipped ready to be downloaded (the combined structure is under the "VectorModulator_Tuning" file).
